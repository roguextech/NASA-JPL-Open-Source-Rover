## Adding new parts to the parts list

1. Add an image of the part at /images/components. This image will be utilized
within the documentation to represent the part, often in the "part tables" at the
start of a section.

2. Add a line to the /parts_list/master_parts_list_raw.csv file describing the new part.
This CSV file is a standard text file; do not use Excel or Numbers to edit it as
doing so will change the encoding. The format is:

> Part Name, Sold in packs of, Site, Project Reference Code, Price Each, Link, Total used in project, Extras to buy, Optional notes
